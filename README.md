### About me
I took a decision of coding because I am passionate about it. Also, by the time I will be done taking those courses, I will be in a position where developing websites and mobiles applications will be part of my career. 

### Why I decided to take coding lessons
I choose coding because I found that it will help me to think out of the box. The more I code, the higher chances I get of solving many problems that I encounter with in daily life.

### My wish for other girls.
There are plenty girls out there who don't know what coding is, yet they have the willingness of being engaged into it. Therefore, my message to them is that coding is one of the best experiences they will have in case they take a decision of getting into that path, and one thing to highlight is that the sky is the limit. Yes, they can do it!
